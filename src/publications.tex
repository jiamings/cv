% Under review by \textit{the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)}.

% My contributions include using stochastic methods to greatly improve the inference speed of the original algorithm. With my enhancement, the algorithm can now do inference on networks with millions of nodes, whereas it could only do a few hundred nodes previously.
