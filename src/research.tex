\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{\footnotesize November 2014 -- Current}{State Key Lab of Intelligent Tech. and Systems (TNList)}{Tsinghua University}{}{Advisor: Prof. Jun Zhu}{Further explored more acceleration method for link prediction problems. Proposed an efficient method that would train on a network with over 3 million nodes, which is over ten thousand times increase over original methods. Submitting to IEEE Trans. PAMI.}{}

\cventry{\footnotesize July 2014 -- October 2014}{Visual Computing Group}{Microsoft Research Asia}{}{Advisor: Jingdong Wang}{Worked on classification and detection algorithms using deep learning methods; studied and modified Caffe, and open-source deep learning framework in C++ and CUDA; developed a convolutional neural network for multiple label image annotation which achieved state-of-the-art precision results.}{}

\cventry{\footnotesize October 2013 -- June 2014}{State Key Lab of Intelligent Tech. and Systems (TNList)}{Tsinghua University}{}{Advisor: Prof. Jun Zhu}{Explored and implemented stochastic variational inference methods for max-margin latent feature relational model, which is used for link prediction. Implemented a Gibbs sampling benchmark algorithm for Scalable Inference for Logistic Normal Topic Models (accepted by NIPS 2013).}{}
